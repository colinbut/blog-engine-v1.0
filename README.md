This web application is very trivial where it allows users to login to the blog site and view a list of all blogs entered into the blog system. Currently the top 10 blogs are displayed upon successful login. 

This blog allows users to:
1. Users can add new blog posts by clicking on "new post"
2. Users can click on the "list posts" to view the entire list of blog posts. 
3. Users can also search for specific blog posts by typing in search keyword in the search bar.


This simple blog site is built using just PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also makes uses of a number of independent JavaScript libraries for front end validation and behaviours.
